### CPSC 120

* Lab 6
    
    Lab 6, parts 1 and 2 were great because I liked implementing and using vectors alongside command line arguments for the first time. It really added to the future complexity of the programs we'd edit in later labs and was very satisfying to get working with my lab partners. I think for some arbitrary reason my brain really likes whenever it gets the chance to convert a vector with a stoi or stod, it's just clean. 

* Lab 8

    I enjoyed lab 8 particularly because I think loops are cool to imagine and execute once you're finished going through the sometimes annoying process of writing them. Having more control over the order and how my computer is going to compile and execute these types of programs really changed how I saw the future labs we did, and I thought the syntax was a little more intuitive and human to read and type.

* Lab 10
    
    Lab 10 was the use of 2D vectors, and I quickly found it more interesting than most other labs because I could immediately see how it would have real world application. It was fun and easy visualizing how a code utilizing it would run to search for elements in columns and rows, and then do whatever we told it to do with that integer information. It was kind of frustrating at first, but memorizing the syntax was still satisfying even if it felt convoluted at first.
